This repo contains three exercises going over Chapter 4 - Exception Handling.

Exercise 1 - Prompts the user to enter two integers and handles InputMismatchException.

Exercise 2 - Creates an array of 50 random double values, then handles two exceptions:
InputMismatchException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Exercise 3 - Uses Triangle.java to create triangle objects with 3 double attributes, 
            IllegalTriangleSideException.java as a custom exception if two sides of createdtriangle
            are less than third side,
            TriangleTester.java to test a valid triangle and an invalid triangle using IllegalTriangleSideException
References - ChatGPT, used during creation of Exercise2.java, asked for help in creating an array of 50 random double values.
The screenshots of those results are in this repository.

UML Diagram for Exercise 3 is in this repo as well.
